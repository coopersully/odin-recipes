  <h1>Did you think I could possibly post a recipe for garlic bread without adding cheese to it?! Never.</h1>
  <h2>Easy Lasagna Recipe</h2>
  <p>
    I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.

    This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese.

    This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>French Bread: The best choice when it comes to garlic bread.</li>
    <li>Butter: High-quality salted butter is best for this recipe. I like to use Cabot or Land O’ Lakes.</li>
    <li>Fresh Garlic: The fresher the better, minced yourself at home.</li>
    <li>Cheese: Parmesan and Mozzarella shredded/grated at home from a block is best for taste and texture.</li>
    <li>Italian Salad Dressing: Optional, but it takes this right up to restaurant quality. I use Olive Garden salad dressing which you can also make at home.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to make it</h2>
  <img src="https://thecozycook.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1J5A6755.jpg" alt="Visual aid for steps described below">
    <ol>
      <li>Slice the bread in half to create two thinner pieces of equal size.</li>
      <li>Combine room temperature butter, minced garlic, 1 cup Mozzarella cheese, and Italian Salad Dressing.Spread it evenly over each slice of bread. Top with Parmesan, then with remaining 2 cups of Mozzarella.</li>
      <li>Bake at 350° for 10 minutes, then increase heat to 450° and baked until the top begins to brown, up to 8 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Cut into 1-inch slices, garnish with parsley, and serve with pasta, soup, or homemade marinara sauce.</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Pro Tip</h2>
  <p>
    French Bread is the best kind to use for this recipe. It has crispy outer crust which allows it to hold up well, and it’s soft in the middle which is perfect for absorbing the cheesy garlic butter spread!  </p>
