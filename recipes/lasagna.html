  <h1>This Lasagna Recipe is easy to make with a creamy ricotta cheese mixture, savory meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese.</h1>
  <h2>Easy Lasagna Recipe</h2>
  <p>
    I suppose since I have recipes for Skillet Lasagna, Lasagna Soup, Lasagna Roll Ups, and Taco Lasagna, we are long overdue for me to share my easy, classic lasagna recipe.

    This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese.

    This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat super well.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li> ¼ tsp pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to make it</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish.</li>
      <li>Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles).</li>
      <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Repeat the same layers two more times.</li>
      <li>Cover and bake at 375° for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes.</li>
      <li>Broil at the end if desired.</li>
      <li>Let it rest for 15 minutes prior to serving with <a href="garlic-bread-with-cheese.html">Garlic Bread with Cheese</a></li>
    </ol>
  <h2>How many layers does lasagna have?</h2>
  <p>
    Lasagna needs to have at least 3 layers in order to constitute a true lasagna. Most recipes have 3 or 4 layers.
    I opted for 3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish.
